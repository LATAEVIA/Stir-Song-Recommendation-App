# _STIR - A Compelling Song Suggestion Android App_

#### _Utilizing the Spotify Web &amp; Echo Nest APIs Stir is designed to take music discovery to a new level. Not by comparing artists, release dates, or even genres, but the actual songs themselves. Built as an final project during my Android class at Epicodus, Stir serves to identify how music moves you, what you find compelling; what exactly about a song causes you to stir. While identifying these traits of a favorite song, such as certain timbres, chord progressions, or beats per minute, Stir begin compiling similar songs, making music discovery seamless., 07/01/2016_
